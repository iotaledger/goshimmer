# v0.1.0 - 2020-01-31

> Note that this release is a complete breaking change, therefore node operators are instructed to upgrade.

This release mainly integrates the shared codebase between Hornet and GoShimmer called [hive.go](https://github.com/iotaledger/hive.go), 
to foster improvements in both projects simultaneously. Additionally, the autopeering code from [autopeering-sim](https://github.com/iotaledger/autopeering-sim)
has been integrated into the codebase. For developers a Go client library is now available to communicate
with a GoShimmer node in order to issue, get and search zero value transactions and retrieve neighbor information.
