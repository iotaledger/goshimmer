# Protocol specification

:::warning DISCLAIMER

The following sections describe how things are implemented in GoShimmer. They might not reflect the final IOTA 2.0 specification or implementation.

:::

In this chapter we provide an overview of the various protocol components.

We start with a [high level overview](protocol.md) of the protocol, followed by sections explaining the various implemented components.

Note, this chapter is still work in progress.
