# Tooling

GoShimmer comes with some tools to test the stability of the protocol. 

We provide a documentation for the following tools:

- The [docker private network](docker_private_network.md) with which a local test network can be set up locally with docker.
- The [integration tests](integration_tests.md) spins up a `tester` container within which every test can specify its own GoShimmer network with Docker.
- The [cli-wallet](../tutorials/wallet_library.md) is described as part of the tutorial section.
