# Welcome 

At the IOTA Foundation we love the vision of decentralization - and this also applies to our documentation.

That' s why each project gets its own documentation page, with learning material like guides and tutorials.

In this Blog you will get updates and more information about the GoShimmer documentation, and get the latest insights from the team.

Happy developing!
