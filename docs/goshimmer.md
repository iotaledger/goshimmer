# Welcome
Welcome to the GoShimmer docs!

GoShimmer is a prototype node software exploring the implementation of [the Coordicide project](https://coordicide.iota.org/). This wiki helps the reader to understand the basic concepts and ideas behind the Coordicide and how its modules are implemented in GoShimmer.

Due to the prototypical nature of the project, things written today may not be reflecting how things are tomorrow. We seek to keep the docs as updated as possible, since it is also used as guide for our team. If you find any inconsistencies, feel free to contact us on Discord or better, [create an issue on this repository](https://github.com/iotaledger/goshimmer/issues/new/choose).
